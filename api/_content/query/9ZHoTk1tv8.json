The increasing complexity and size of some projects requires a suitable tool to address the subject effectively. Some authors define “engineering” as the application of mathematical and scientific principles. In this context, the ability to propose, execute and improve complex planning schedules is of paramount importance. A basic schedule is a general guidance for preparing and releasing various types of technical plans. These documents include technical management plans (such as hardware development plans, software development plans, configuration and data management plans, and risk management plans), supporting technical plans (such as system safety plans, manufacturing plans, and system support plans) and test plans (such as system integration, test, and verification plans and hardware and software test plans), to cite some. Due the relevance of the theme when dealing with complex projects, in this paper a methodology for task planning, analysis and optimization is proposed. A draft planning containing task dependence, time duration and used resource may be provided by the manager. The proposed framework is able to import such information from commercially available management software. The schedule is then translated as an optimization problem, where the overall time is the objective to be minimized. Resource allocation and risk management are considered by means of weighting factors. Pareto framework is considered in order to provide visibility of alternative scenarios. The proposed formulation considers different task priorities of the optimal planning. As a result, relevant information about optimal scheduling and sensitivity of alternative scenarios is provided. Numerical results show the viability of the proposed methodology.\n","authors":["Geraldo Ribeiro","Rogério Santos"],"downloadLinks":["http://www.abcm.org.br/anais/cobem/2009/pdf/COB09-1394.pdf","https://geraldo.dev/paper/COB09-1394.pdf"],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"introduction"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"INTRODUCTION"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Nowadays, more than ever, companies want to deliver products and services\nbetter, faster, and cheaper.
