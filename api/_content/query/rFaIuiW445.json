This work\ncompares the existing droplet size distribution available in the literature\nand based on Tanasawa et al. fully experimental models with an extension of\na theoretical model primarily developed for fan spray atomizers which has\nbeen recently improved for impinging jets and then modified to fit the\nbehavior of Y-jet atomizers and pressure swirl atomizers. The results were\nfound quite satisfactory for case of reasonably viscous fluids but not so for\nlow viscosity ones the reason possibly being that Tanasawa's correlation does\nnot contain the viscosity coefficient.\n","year":2002,"keywords":["rotating cup and disk atomozers","spray","droplets"],"authors":["Heraldo Couto","Geraldo Ribeiro","Dem√©trio Bastos Netto"],"downloadLinks":["https://geraldo.dev/papers/CIT02-0895.pdf","http://abcm.org.br/app/webroot/anais/encit/2002/Paper-title/03/CIT02-0895.PDF"],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"TBD"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:paper:note-on-rotating-cup-atomizer-theory.md","_source":"content","_file":"paper/note-on-rotating-cup-atomizer-theory.md","_extension":"md"}
