This facility is a ground-based\nstructure that can emulate the space environment for testing and qualifying\nsatellite thrusters and satellite propulsive loops. A structure like this\nrequires the prompt availability of data treatment tools which must be\nextensible to encapsulate the particular needs of the customers. The original\ndata treatment package supplied by the test bench development team needed\na strong work to customize the available features. However several\nconstraints were imposed for us, like: a) support for low amount of data; b)\nlarge time slices were required for processing the acquired data; c) poor\nfinal output quality; d) specific hardware requirements; e) non portability;\nf) specific language used for coding the scripts; etc. The CATPA came up to\noverride these constraints and to make the data treatment easier and much\nmore powerful. It uses modern concepts like design patterns and standard\ntemplate library, making the reuse of code and the rapid application\ndevelopment easier to be reached.\n",keywords:[],authors:["Geraldo Ribeiro","Demétrio Bastos Netto"],downloadLinks:["https:\u002F\u002Farc.aiaa.org\u002Fdoi\u002F10.2514\u002F6.IAC-03-U.P.09","http:\u002F\u002Fmtc-m16.sid.inpe.br\u002Fcol\u002Fsid.inpe.br\u002Fmarciana\u002F2004\u002F01.28.15.42\u002Fdoc\u002Fdata.pdf","https:\u002F\u002Fgeraldo.dev\u002Fpaper\u002FIAC-03-U.P.09.pdf"],body:{type:d,children:[{type:a,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:f},{type:a,tag:g,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:h}]},{type:b,value:i}]},{type:a,tag:j,props:{"video-id":k},children:[]}],toc:{title:"",searchDepth:l,depth:l,links:[]}},_type:"markdown",_id:"content:paper:a-data-treatment-tool-for-a-satellite-thruster-test-facility.md",_source:"content",_file:"paper\u002Fa-data-treatment-tool-for-a-satellite-thruster-test-facility.md",_extension:"md"}},prerenderedAt:1664045653501}}("element","text",false,"root","p","Below is an excellent video where ","strong","Aguinaldo Serra Jr"," shows BTSA (Banco de\nTestes com Simulação de Altitude) where CATPA was developed at the beginning of\ndecade and is still used today.","youtube-embed","tLw3cc1Esbc",2))
