How to avoid ecto logs inside iex?

...

You can either change your log level (in iex):

Logger.configure(level: :info)
Or in your config:

config :logger, level: :info
You can disable Ecto's logs entirely with:

config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  loggers: []
As described in https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Repo.html
